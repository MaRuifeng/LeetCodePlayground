Given a string `s` and an array of strings words, return the number of `words[i]` that is a subsequence of `s`.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

Example 1:

```aidl
Input: s = "abcde", words = ["a","bb","acd","ace"]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three strings in words that are a subsequence of s: "a", "acd", "ace".
```

Example 2:
```aidl
Input: s = "dsahjpjauf", words = ["ahjpjau","ja","ahbwzgqnuk","tnmlanowax"]
Output: 2
```
